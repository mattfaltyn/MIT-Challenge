# MIT Challenge

Inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I am going to complete 11 MIT computer science courses in under 12 months through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

During my formal training in mathematics, I spent some time writing and analyzing software. Getting a taste of computer science through programming only increased my interest in understanding how computers work.

I am embarking on this journey to accomplish one major objective: develop a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. From reviewing the MIT computer science curriculum and comparing it to my university transcript, I believe that the main gap in my understanding of computer science is precisely these two concepts. 

Listed below are the 11 classes I will be covering. For each of these classes, I will create and publish a short document that contains the notes that I found most interesting or important.

## Learning Progress (2/12):

### 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science
- Instructor(s): Prof. Albert R. Meyer & Prof. Adam Chlipala
- Term: Spring 2015
- Status: Complete
- Start date: April 27, 2022
- Completion date: May 5, 2022

**Matt's Review**: 6.042J was almost all review from a collection of introductory undergrad math courses (mostly number theory, group theory, graph theory, and real analysis with a sprinkle of probability at the end). It was a well designed course with easy-to-follow course notes. **5/5!**


### 6.004: Computation Structures
- Instructor(s): Prof. Chris Terman
- Term: Spring 2017
- Status: Complete
- Start date: May 15, 2022
- Completion date: June 30, 2022

**Matt's Review**: Having never taken a computer hardware course, most of 6.004 was new material. Terman does a great job of making the video lectures engaging and succinct. I found the complexity of the computing stack fascinating and overhelming. Reading reddit reviews, I can see how students found the course assessments extremely challenging; the amount of technical nuance that is hidden away at each abstraction layer is on a good day, humbling, and on a bad day, terrifying. I found reading Essentials of Computer Architecture (2nd Edition) by Douglas Comer exremely helpful during this course. It was a doozy but well worth the time! **5/5!** 


### 6.005: Software Construction
- Instructor(s): Prof. Robert Miller & Dr. Max Goldman
