# MIT Challenge

Inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I am going to complete 12 MIT computer science courses in under 12 months through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

During my formal training in mathematics, I spent some time writing and analyzing software. Getting a taste of computer science through programming only increased my interest in understanding how computers work.

I am embarking on this journey to accomplish one major objective: develop a thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures. From reviewing the MIT computer science curriculum and comparing it to my university transcript, I believe that the main gap in my understanding of computer science is precisely these two concepts. 

Listed below are the 12 classes I will be covering. For each of these classes, I will create and publish a short document that contains the notes that I found most interesting or important. Additionally, I will create a small implementation of one of the course's topics in Rust.

## Learning Progress (1/12):

### 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science
- Instructor(s): Prof. Albert R. Meyer & Prof. Adam Chlipala
- Term: Spring 2015
- Start date: April 27, 2022
- Completion date: May 5, 2022
- Project: Raw implementation of RSA cryptosystem 
- Status: Complete

**Matt's Review**: 6.042J was almost all review from a collection of introductory undergrad math courses (mostly number theory, group theory, graph theory, and real analysis with a sprinkle of probability at the end). It was a well designed course with easy-to-follow course notes. 5/5!
