# MIT-Challenge

Inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I am going to complete 12 MIT computer science courses in under 12 months through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

During my formal training in mathematics, I spent some time writing and analyzing software. Getting a taste of computer science through programming only increased my interest in understanding how computers work.

I am embarking on this journey to accomplish one major objective: develop a thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures. From reviewing the MIT computer science curriculum and comparing it to my university transcript, I believe that the main gap in my understanding of computer science is precisely these two concepts. 

Listed below are the 12 classes I will be taking. For each of these classes, I will create and publish a 5-10 page (excluding images and references) summary of the course material.
