# MIT Challenge

Inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I am going to complete 5 MIT computer science courses in under 4 months through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

During my formal training in mathematics, I spent some time writing and analyzing software. Getting a taste of computer science through programming only increased my interest in understanding how computers work.

I am embarking on this journey to accomplish one major objective: develop a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. From reviewing the MIT computer science curriculum and comparing it to my university transcript, I believe that the main gap in my understanding of computer science is precisely these two concepts. 

Listed below are the 5 classes I will be covering. For each of these classes, I will either a) create and publish a short document that contains the notes that I found most interesting or important or b) create Anki notes.

## Learning Progress (5/5):

### 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science
- Instructor(s): Prof. Albert R. Meyer & Prof. Adam Chlipala
- Term: Spring 2015
- Status: Complete
- Start date: April 27, 2022
- Completion date: May 5, 2022

**Matt's Review**: 6.042J was almost all review from a collection of introductory undergrad math courses (mostly number theory, group theory, graph theory, and real analysis with a sprinkle of probability at the end). It was a well designed course with easy-to-follow course notes. **5/5!**


### 6.004: Computation Structures
- Instructor(s): Prof. Chris Terman
- Term: Spring 2017
- Status: Complete
- Start date: May 15, 2022
- Completion date: June 30, 2022

**Matt's Review**: Having never taken a computer hardware course, most of 6.004 was new material. Terman does a great job of making the video lectures engaging and succinct. I found the complexity of the computing stack fascinating and overhelming. Reading reddit reviews, I can see how students found the course assessments extremely challenging; the amount of technical nuance that is hidden away at each abstraction layer is on a good day, humbling, and on a bad day, terrifying. I found reading Essentials of Computer Architecture (2nd Edition) by Douglas Comer exremely helpful during this course. It was a doozy but well worth the time! **5/5!** 


### 6.005: Software Construction
- Instructor(s): Prof. Robert Miller & Dr. Max Goldman
- Term: Spring 2016
- Status: Complete
- Start date: July 1, 2022
- Completion date: July 11, 2022

**Matt's Review**: 6.005 started out strong. Its focus on how to write software that is safe from bugs, easy to understand, and ready for change (i.e., the three main themes of the course) never left me wondering why I was studying the material. However, the quality of the course material began to oscillate after Reading 17; some chapters would be very strong while others would fall flat. I think this course could benefit from further modularization, particularly in the later half. A book such as Code Complete (2nd edition) by Steve McConnell may be a better introduction to software development. **3.5/5.**


### 6.006 & 6.046J: Algorithms (First two courses)
- Textbook: Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein
- Status: Complete
- Start date: July 12, 2022
- Completion date: August 26, 2022

Matt's Review: TBD
